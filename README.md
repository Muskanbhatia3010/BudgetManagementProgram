# BudgetManagementProgram
The idea for this project originated based on the need to make the behemoth task of financial planning relatively effortless and straightforward. As students, we are new to money management and so the whole process can seem a little intimidating and daunting. Even saving a little money is a difficult task let alone tracking all our expenses. BUDGET.LY, a program built using C language on Code Blocks, is designed to help curb overspending. This application uses an algorithm to track your daily expenditure, display your current balance and to earn you gift coupons if you manage to meet your goals. All our functionalities are specifically designed to track and improve your spending habits. BUDGET.LY allows users to enter all their daily expenses in several categories and helps them keep tabs on where their money goes and how they can save more. We believe it is imperative to stay motivated to achieve your goals and so BUDGET.LY rewards the users when they accomplish their goal for the month by giving them points which can be claimed later for gift coupons. In the future we wish to enhance our application by introducing a premium membership, personalised investment plans and many more features.
